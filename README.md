# MachineLearningProject
This is for my Machine Learning Project

There are two folders, Data and src. Data contains the data file used for this project. The source file contains the 
different Machine Learning algorithms used as exploration for this project. 

In the Predictions.py file, I used Scikit-Learn for the different learning algorithms. I also have code to predict the test 
data and write the submission file.

My first submission was the DummySubmission.csv file. My latest submission is the Submission.csv file.

I also did some data exploration in R, that file is called Values.R. In there I create graphs of the different variables 
in the data.
